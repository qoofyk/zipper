as long as there are two threads(writer&sender) launched, MPI_Send() will become 10 times
slower. Maybe related to cores? --- Yes!!!

# In Makefile, change CRB to 8GB
# use getenv to get SCRATCH_DIR, so that we don't need to specify the bridges, comet, BG2 or other mac info.
# In jobscript, use export to make SCRATCH_DIR environment variable
# In inter.sh, you cannnot use CRB to 8GB, besides change laucher to mpirun,
and slumjobid=111

# Fix Bug: In analysis_reader.c, bug in passing (char*)buffer -> ((int*)buffer)[0] to decide *(read_wrong) increas
# change get_cur_time to MPI_Wtime
# use "%lf" to printf double --> Whether can avoid T_create getting "-nan"?
	# No !!!
	# Fix Bug: In do_thread.c, init_lv() Need to specify lv->gen_time=0;
# Temp Fix Bug: For analysis proc, use two different FD to read and write for the same file
